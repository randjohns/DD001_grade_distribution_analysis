dean data series: a sample of how to analyze grade distributions from raw data

This is my first installment in the "Dean Data" series, aimed at empowering deans and chairs to draw conclusions from large sets of data which can elude us when working in Excel (or, at minimum, eat up hours of our time when we should be taking actions based on the data!).

The raw data file and later analyses by individual faculty is not included here for confidentiality reasons.

Enjoy!
